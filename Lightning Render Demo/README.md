Lightning is one of my favourite FF characters, so this is why I chose her for this render demo. I found an OBJ file on the internet. I imported it into Maya to make sure this is the correct one. From Maya I exported it to the correct format that my C++ code would accept. Once the model had successful imported into the OpenGL world, it was just playing around with all the functions available to me!

I highly recommend watching this one!
