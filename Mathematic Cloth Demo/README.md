This project was great fun to make. Using OpenGL knowledge to create the objects and the connections between the particles. The maths behind it was excellent when there were no problems. I found doing all the calculations on pen and paper help me understand it more and prevent any errors being accidently created. 

My next steps with this project is to get the cloth drawn in real time rather than having particles and lines to represent it.
